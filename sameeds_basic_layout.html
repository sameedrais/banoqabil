        <dt><b>Vocabulary</b></dt>
        <dd>Being a good speaker means constantly growing your vocabulary. The more interesting words you know, the stronger your speaking skills would be.</dd>

        <dt><b>Grammar</b></dt>
        <dd>Grammar does matter, however; fewer mistakes you are allowed to make. But a good speaker does not have to use perfect grammer.</dd>

        <dd>It's a complex area that needs practice. A skilled speaker knows the sub-skills of pronunciation that include; word stress, intonation, and rhythm.</dd>

    <h2><u>Public Speaking</u></h2>

    <h2><u>Informative Speaking</u></h2>
    <p>An <u>informative speech</u> is like a presentation where the goal is to increase others’ knowledge understanding, or abilities. <i>For instance,</i> you might give an informative speech that aims to increase listeners’ understanding of how science works and to teach them what are the wonders of science.</p>

    <h2><u>Persuasive Speaking</u></h2>
    <p>Most of us won’t give persuasive speeches regularly but in some cases, we are asked to make <u>persuasive</u> presentations. Its goal is to change others by prompting them to think, feel, believe, or act differently. <i>For instance,</i> your manager might want you to persuade a potential client that your firm can provide the best service, so you speak to persuade others to ideas or actions that you think are right or desirable.</p>
